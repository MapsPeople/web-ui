# MapsIndoors Web UI

This monorepo contains all UI projects for the MapsIndoors platform for Web. It is managed with [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org), which makes it easier to work with multiple connected projects in one repo, like this.

The repo consists of these _packages_, which are all found in the `packages` folder:

- [`components`](https://github.com/MapsPeople/web-ui/blob/main/packages/components/README.md), the MapsIndoors Web Components found at [@mapsindoors/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mapsindoors/components)
- `demos`, a collection of demos of how to use the _packages_ in this repo
- [`map-template`](https://github.com/MapsPeople/web-ui/blob/main/packages/map-template/README.md), the MapsIndoors Map Template, a React app helping you get up and running fast and easy
- [`midt`](https://github.com/MapsPeople/web-ui/blob/main/packages/midt/README.md), i.e. MapsIndoors Design Tokens, a design library used as the foundation for UI styles across MapsIndoors

## A quick primer on Lerna

Built on top of [npm's Workspaces feature](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces?v=true), [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org) makes sure you install the packages defined in each individual _package's_ `package.json`. In this case, from `components`, `map-template` and `midt`. At the same time, you install the latest version of each of those projects so you can work with them across your _packages_ in this repo. We often make changes to `components` we need for a feature in the `map-template` project. Using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org), we don't have to deal with `npm link`, but can work on one feature across projects easily.

## Conventional Commits

We use, and heavily rely on, the use of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Conventional Commits lets us write commits in a standardized fashion, no matter the contributor, and since we follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org), we can keep everything in check more easily following the standards.

If your contribution to this repository doesn't follow these standards, it might be rejected, so please familiarize yourself with them before opening Pull Requests.
