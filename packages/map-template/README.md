# Map Template

This app is built on React, with our Web Components used where applicable.

## Running the app

To get the app up and running, clone this repo, install everything using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org), and start the app:

```zsh
$ git clone git@github.com:MapsPeople/web-ui.git
$ cd web-ui && npm install && npx lerna run build
$ cd packages/map-template && npm run start
```

The Map Template has a main `MapsIndoorsMap` React component. It wraps the whole app inside of it. It's used in a function in `App.js` which is imported into `index.js` where it's defined that an HTML element with `id="root"` will render the app. We show how that is done in `packages/map-template/public/index.html`.

### Adding Google Maps API Keys or Mapbox Access Tokens

Rename `.env.example`, to `.env` and add either of the keys (or both) to that file, and the maps will load properly.

### React Components

We follow [the React convention](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#avoid-too-much-nesting) with one level of depth in the Components' folder. We still import React components into each other (even in multiple levels), but the folder structure is flat.

### Web Components

We use our own Web Components ([Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements)) from `packages/components` inside of the Map Template. To illustrate the relation between the React app, its React Components and our Web Components, here's a drawing of how this works in the Route Instructions part of the app:

```
// public/index.html

- App.js
 - MapsIndoorsMap
  - BottomSheet
   - Directions
    - RouteInstructions
     - mi-route-instructions-step
      - mi-icon
      - mi-time
      - mi-distance
```

The `mi-route-instructions-step` Web Component uses `mi-route-instructions-maneuver` to render sub steps, `mi-icon` for icons, and `mi-time` and `mi-distance` to show estimated time and distance.

We use `mi-route-instructions-step` in the React Component `RouteInstructions` to show, well, route instructions. This is used inside of an "umbrella" component for all directions (including searching for where to go) called `Directions`.

Everything in the app is displayed in the `BottomSheet` (on mobile viewports), and the main app component is named `MapsIndoorsMap`.

If you have a React app, you can use any of these React Components in your own app. If you want to not use a bottom sheet for instance, you could import the `Directions` component and work with that in your app.

#### Working on Components used in Map Template

To have any Stencil component changes be reflected in this project, you need to run  `npx lerna run build` from the root folder. There are no watch scripts yet.

## Supported properties on the MapsIndoors Map component

|Property|Type|Description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`apiKey`|`string`|The MapsIndoors Solution you want to load. Takes both API key as string and "App alias". |
|`gmApiKey`|`string`|Your Google Maps API key. |
|`mapboxAccessToken`|`string`|Your Mapbox Access Token. Setting it will load a Mapbox map. If you set both a Mapbox Access Token and Google Maps API key, the Mapbox Access Token takes precedence. |
|`venue`|`string`|The Venue to load from your MapsIndoors Solution. |
|`locationId`|`string`|Set a MapsIndoors Location ID to show it on the map and its details in the sheet. |
|`primaryColor`|`string`|The primary color to use throughout the app. |
|`logo`|`string`|The logo to show during initial load. |
|`directionsFrom`|`string`|Set a MapsIndoors Location ID to be used as origin to instantly show directions. Must be used together with `directionsTo`|
|`directionsTo`|`string`|Set a MapsIndoors Location ID to be used as destination to instantly show directions. Must be used together with `directionsFrom`|
